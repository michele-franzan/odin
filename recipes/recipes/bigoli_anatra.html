        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bigoli all'anatra is a classic Venetian dish featuring thick, whole wheat spaghetti-like pasta called bigoli,
           tossed in a rich and flavorful duck ragù. The slow-cooked duck becomes incredibly tender and its flavors 
           meld beautifully with aromatics and often a touch of sweetness from white wine or vegetables. This rustic 
           yet elegant dish is a true taste of the Veneto region.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Duck Ragù:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound boneless duck legs (or a whole duck, broken down), skin removed and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, finely diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken or duck broth</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 sprig of fresh rosemary (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste (optional, for richer flavor)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Bigoli</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dried bigoli pasta</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prepare the Duck Ragù:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped duck and sear on all sides until nicely browned. This step helps to render some of the 
                fat and develop flavor. Remove the duck from the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the finely chopped onion, diced carrot, and diced celery to the pot. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If using, stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Pour in the dry white wine and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits. Let the wine 
                simmer and reduce by about half, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return the browned duck to the pot. Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice), chicken or duck broth, 
                bay leaf, and rosemary sprig (if using). Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring the ragù to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook gently for at least 2 hours, 
                or up to 3 hours, until the duck is very tender and easily shreds with a fork. Stir occasionally and 
                add more broth if the sauce becomes too thick.</li>
            <li>Once the duck is cooked, remove it from the pot and shred it using two forks. Discard the bay leaf and 
                rosemary sprig.</li>
            <li>Return the shredded duck meat to the sauce and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. 
                Keep the ragù warm over low heat while the pasta cooks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cook the Bigoli Pasta:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add the dried bigoli pasta and cook according to the package directions until al dente (firm to the 
                bite). Bigoli typically takes a bit longer to cook than regular spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.</li>
            <li>Drain the cooked bigoli in a colander.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Toss and Serve:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the drained bigoli pasta directly to the pot with the warm duck ragù.</li>
            <li>Toss well to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the 
                reserved pasta cooking water until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Divide the bigoli all'anatra among individual serving plates.</li>
            <li>Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh parsley (if desired). Serve immediately 
                and enjoy this authentic Venetian delicacy!</li>
        </ul>
