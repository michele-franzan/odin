            <li>1 pound ground beef (80/20 blend recommended)</li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork (optional, but adds flavor)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry red wine</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Besciamella Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 cups whole milk, warmed</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound dried lasagna pasta (not no-boil)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Prepare the Bolognese Sauce (Ragù):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the diced carrots and celery and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until slightly tender.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to medium-high and add the ground beef and ground pork (if using). Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Pour in the red wine and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits. Let the wine simmer and reduce slightly, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, whole milk, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for at least 2 hours, or up to 3 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the richer the flavor will be. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a little water or beef broth. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prepare the Besciamella Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to form a smooth roux. Do not let it brown.</li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in the warm milk, a little at a time, ensuring each addition is fully incorporated and smooth before adding more. Continue whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
            <li>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer over medium heat, stirring continuously, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the nutmeg. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. Cover the sauce with plastic wrap directly on the surface to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cook the Lasagna Pasta:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Add the lasagna pasta, a few at a time, and cook according to the package directions until al dente (slightly undercooked). Be careful not to overcook them, as they will continue to cook in the oven.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove the cooked pasta with a slotted spoon or tongs and lay them flat on a lightly oiled baking sheet or clean kitchen towels to prevent them from sticking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assemble the Lasagna:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the Bolognese sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Arrange a layer of lasagna pasta over the sauce, slightly overlapping if necessary.</li>
            <li>Spread a layer of the Bolognese sauce over the pasta, followed by a layer of the besciamella sauce. Sprinkle generously with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers: pasta, Bolognese sauce, besciamella sauce, and Parmesan cheese, until all the ingredients are used. The top layer should be pasta, topped with the remaining besciamella sauce and a generous amount of Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>If desired, dot the top with a few small knobs of butter for extra richness and browning.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bake the Lasagna:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lasagna is bubbling, the cheese is melted and golden brown, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to serve.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired. Serve hot with extra grated Parmesan cheese on the side.</li>
        </ul>
